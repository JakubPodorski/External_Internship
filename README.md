1.Import random is placed so that random.randint could be used later.
2.User is asked for his name via input. Variable name is created.
3.User is greeted by text and his variable name is provided.
4.User is asked if he needs assistance. Variable decision is created.He should answer "y" or "no"
5.Based on decision variable his if/elif/else is placed:
a) if "y" was typed then user is asked to type numbers corresponding to relevant cuisines. There is variable figure created.
b) if "n" was typed then user is informed we could help him next time.
c) if neither "y" nor "n" was typed then there is a message indicating that he didn't type properly.
FOR Improvement: When variant C is triggered then user should be taken to step 4. I tried with While function but didn't succeed.
6. Cuisine is a list of 3 types of cuisine: Italian, Arabic, Chinese.
7. Variable figure indicates index of cuisine type in a list. Eg Index 0 is Italian. User chose index previously.
8. Fruits is a list of fruit. There are 4 types of fruits.
9. User is asked how many fruits he would like to get for the dish. There is input a variable number_of_fruit. It is defined as INT.
10. fruits_to_be_used = [] is an empty list of fruits. It will be filled out on the basis of loop.
11. There is loop that fills out previously mentioned empty list. Append function got used here.
12. User receives information which fruits he chose and again his type of cuisine.
FOR Improvement:Print-out of list elements should be more legible.
13. User is notified a payment time
14. Bill variable is created. Random.randint function is used and amount can be from 1 to 100.
15. Function bill_with_tip is created. It adds 20 % to the bill.
16. In variable tip, user chooses if he would like to pay without tip or with tip.
17. Depending on answer, if/elif functions provide relevant message.
